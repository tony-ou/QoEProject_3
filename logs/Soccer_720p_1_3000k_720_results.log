#REASONING#
###########

A2R75YFKVALBXE: Experiment guidelines are fine, and side-by-side helps a lot. No confusion about the grading. I find the stall more annoying than the blur unless the blur is VERY pronounced, in which case I find them both very annoying.
A2SUBE14MAZ17P: The impairments, unclear image, make us see less details. The grading was easy to understand, and the side by side help the grading
A226S9LUL53Q01: It was clear. But the impairments were all the same.
A2QPMJ4GADLUW2: The stalls are annoying as they break up the flow of the action. I did not see blurs in any of my test videos. The grading is a bit confusing as it is subjective and I don;t know if there is a "right" answer. I did not need the side by side, and I would prefer it was not there so I could have all the space for the test video and to have it larger.
A1GV1WGA3W6CLG: I didn't notice any blurring at all. A single stall is not too bad but if it happens frequently it would be extremely annoying. Don't see the need for the side-by-side.
A187QIQEL3S4HP: The impairments affected just a little bit my experience. The stalls were more annoying and the guidelines were clear. The side-by-side comparison helps a lot.
AHKOW1B4BF0F2: The impairments are more annoying if they appear in the middle of the video. The guideline was clear. The side-by-side comparison was very helpful
ACBG07QLGIDP0: I think the stalling bad experience is highly dependent on the timestamp it occurs. I didn't see any blurring on the videos I was supposed to grade but in general, it was pretty straightforward. On the last question, I think it's important to have the reference video available to check. Not always necessary, but sometimes it is, so leave it available. One more thing. Give more time to the conclusion of the task. I did this one before, with the blurr impairment, and lost the reward because it took me more than 20min to finish the task and answer this final question. The task is very interesting by the way.
A1EGQAMPW9N5FT: When the impairment happen in a crucial moment, like when someone is to shoot, is more annoying
AFIK3VBMMX6G6: short stalls are slightly annoying but more so during climactic moments. Without subsequent blur they can be forgiven quickly
A1H2AHH07EK4MC: If video stalls where there is interesting place it will be more frustrating. Guideline is understandable and  I'm clear on Grading system. No Side by side comparison will create more confusion 
A317RA15E0SZ4P: There are only very subtle differences and side by side comparison makes the videos smaller, even on a big screen. So, it is very difficult to identify impairments, especially blurs. Regarding stalls, they are more annoying when they occur at key moments in a match rather than at times when the match has paused. There was very little noticeable blur in the videos except maybe one. However, all of them stalled at different times during the video.
AAY0F6L5N4TXR: side by side comparisons didnt help much
A34YKQXWOMUZRC: Everything is very clear.
A14YT4Q8ZT8GYJ: It's annoying when something important it's going on at the video. it's clear. no confuse. Don't think I should look at the reference again, It's enough. 
A3FYPNNCB7IQ1P: Stallings were annoying, especially in such exciting sport situations.
AOSZUQCXN0K9A: Side by side does help grading. I think stalling is not as annoying as blurring. 
A20863ETFAXW1D: The guidelines were clear enough. I found the 1 second stalling a bit annoying near the beginning of the video, more than at the end. But overall I didn't find it that annoying. There was, however, an issue with the last video not loading (the 7th one). I refreshed and it took me to this page. I couldn't rate the last video, as it never showed (the example video loaded, though).
A1IMRSDQ7RO9US: i gave the review based on the video quality like blur and stalling.
A8DFFGPH3G3V5: NO.ITS CLEARLY MENTIONED STEPS AND NOBODY WILL EXPECT ANNOYING SUCH A IMPORTANT GAMES.
A2EARNRMFJOSIY: side by side comparison helps me more
A1BANTV8HONS2C: timestamp is not much annoying. the guidelines where clear and there is no confusion to me in understanding. for me i thought only one if you show the reference is enough. no need to show side by side
AEPK8XRFCD0OI: side-by-side comparison helps to better analyze the details
A2FEWB3KWM7KX7: The test is very clear, I was able to understand quickly. Having a better quality video helps to understand the mistakes of the second. The second is made worse by knowing what a good quality is like.
AIV97GGKFRJON: As its placed side by side we are tempted to look into it 
A22TYEGRHFUFQJ: the guideline was very clear, the timestamp is very important, since it is more annoying at crucial moments of the video, side-by-side comparison was not helpful compared to watch the video on a separate view.
A29RR6SV0L4D8C: some videos has low quality.The experiment guideline was clear
A3TLL0KRD80A5Z: Impairments when not a lot of action is happening in the video are acceptable but impairments during interesting timestamps such as scoring of a goal, passing of ball, celebrations can be very irritating and may ruin the whole streaming experience. The experiment guidelines are absolutely clear. No confusions regarding the grading. The initial reference video is more than sufficient for grading, so I don't really need to re look into the reference video again.
A2IOIYS5OKAE6E: I think most impairments are equal to each other. They are very similar. The guideline is clear. Side-by-side is helpful. 
A3RU8J5I8NMKPD  : YES I KNOW THE EXPERIMENT GUIDELINE IS CLEAR SO NOT ON CONFUSED GRADED.
A6KEHDNT925VQ: The impairments at some timesstamps that were crucial to watch were spoiled and that annoyed me. Actually, it seemed the resolution was not good. Not even in the reference video. The guidelines were very clear to me.
