#REASONING#
###########

A3QIG18VHBXBSZ: The stalls were annoying particularly during or preceding a score. Did not notice any blurring of any of the test samples. I didn't really need to look at the reference again. 
AQ53YJDPDDLZ: The pauses right before a kick is annoying because we don't know if they scored or not. I don't need to see the reference again. 
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: Nothing annoyed me. Guideline is superb. I didn't get confused in grading. Side-by-side made it easy but without that too one can grade it
A1T643M1P572AA: i looked at the quality and tried to see if their was a blue or any stalls in the video
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Almost all videos had the same impairments.
A26UIS59SY4NM6: The pausing is the most annoying. It adds frustration to the mix. The blurring is ok in moderation. The side by side is not neede.
A1FGKIKJYSL1MI: Stalling is worse than a slight blur -- I can generally still see what's going on with a blur, but the stalls make me crazy.  The grading was clear.  Only needed to see the reference video once.
A70L26UXLTGLC: At more important points in a video with action in it a pause or a blur is more annoying. The guidelines were clear. I didn't need to continually look at the reference.
A2J237J8KM3OCS: its a matter of action going with timestamps, sometime its annoying and sometime its enhance of your viewing experience 
AZNIEFUIVB2H0: Blurring makes it difficult to understand what is going on.  Stalling is more annoying since it interupts the flow just when you are looking forward to an action.  Quidelines are clear.  Grading is fine.  Side-by-side helps.  Don't need  the reference after a couple of views.
A1MIR0TP081SKT: The stalling of the video is more annoying when there is a most intresting part of the game,All the instructions are clear.
A1CIIX0CB0GR7H: The video pausing during very crucial live-action moments, such as when someone scores a goal, is extremely annoying and takes away from the game enjoyment. The experiment was not clear in that in the beginning when you had us rate the reference video as bad, that video I could only recognize a pause in the video and nothing else. So if I am to use that as a reference, I have to mark anything with a one-second pause as the same. I wish the  timing of the pause was better explained at the beginning as to how we wan that to affect our rating.
A21EZISIJ3JPSW: I think the guidelines were clear, but I wasn't sure about grading.  I would have ranked some of the events as annoying, not very.  I also didn't notice any blurs, but it could have been to the size on my screen. 
A33CFLCMJNHHNC: If the impairment happens at a crucial or exciting part of the video, it is very annoying.  Guideline is clear. Not confused about grading. A reference to a 'bad' video probably is more useful.
A1NH9LK567B862: No need for side by side comparison. Because grading the video isn't that much hard. 
A2RR3R75ECQSKE: I often face stall videos while comparing to blur.
A1IHI23KH87K5W: If happens during replay, not very annoying. If happens when someone about to shoot, very annoying.
A10U3R76C454PP: sometimes the failure occurs at the least indicated moment, hindering the enjoyment of the special moment in the video
A39C1BN9ZSQ0R2: I find stalling annoying no matter what time they happen in a video. Although they are more expected at the start of a video when things are just loading than they are at the end of a video. Everything was clear. I didn't notice any blurring in the test videos, but they all stalled at different points. I didn
A1V6P1ZE6Q8YEW: Yes the time of impairment definitely affects how much I enjoy the video. Really enjoyed the study and understood it well. The grading was easy to understand. Looking at reference video in comparison helped make a judgement..
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: when there is stall for 1-2 sec it is quite annoying and when the player kick the football and then it is stall it is too much annoying and not acceptable
AVOF14300525D: The blur was more difficult for me to distinguish, so it did not annoy me much. The other impairment stopped the video momentarily making you think there was something wrong with the video. That was annoying. The experiment guide is clear. I was not confused about the grading. The side-by-side comparison helped me. 
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: pause of video in between more than 10sec
A39N0WW02VT0MB: in seven videos the videos stuck on different places. the same impairment is annoying the video so that there is confusion to grade it. 
A11SX02CICZN85: The experiment guideline is very clear and easy to understand. nothing is annoying in this hit. I haven't confuse in grading side-by-side comparison helps me to grade it easily. If it start play simultaneous means it will be much more easy   
A2GK8NS27GDFCZ: Stalling has the worst impact for annoyance to me. I don't think I needed the side by side comparison, the video issues were obvious in each one. 
A320QA9HJFUOZO: The impairment negatively affects my experience if it happens at an important time in the video, like during a soccer shot. Impairments are more annoying the more they interfere with the viewing experience. I did not find the side by side comparison very helpful.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Almost all the test videos had stall problem, Experiment guideline is clear, A little confuse on grading as all the test videos looks similar, And side by side comparison helped a lot
