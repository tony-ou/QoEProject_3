#REASONING#
###########

A2R75YFKVALBXE: Stalls are usually the worst for me, completely lifting me out of the simulation of reality; a little bit of blur I can live with if they don't completely obscure the image. Guidelines are clear, nothing confusing, and the side-by-sides are helpful, especially in distinguishing the more subtle changes in blur.
A1TKGFJSMVR2RP: Impairments at beginning time are more annoying than the impairment at the end time. I am little confused about my grading because it was very difficult notice the blurr when the videos are not focussed or zoom in. Side by side comparison is somewhat helpful but I prefer to watch full screen.
A3RU8J5I8NMKPD  : NO...GUIDELINE IS NOT CLEAR BECAUSE CONFUSING ON GRADED.
A226S9LUL53Q01: It was clear. But the impairments were all the same.
A3FYPNNCB7IQ1P: Stallings are not acceptable in such sports oriented streams/videos as it takes away the excitement.
A3U42WL6MGNSAU: Pauses were very disruptive. I'm axious when the video pause. Blur is ok. I'm not confuse with the grading. No side by side is confuse, it's better split
A3IDRQ3JS6XZZ8: Não estou confusa quanto as classificação. As diferenças prejudicam devido ao tempo de paralisação. A comparação lado a lado só foi necessário no primeiro vídeo
AHKOW1B4BF0F2: The impairments are more annoying if they appear in the middle of the video. The guideline was clear. The side-by-side comparison was very helpful
A1IMRSDQ7RO9US: i gave the review based on the video quality like blur and stalling.
ACDUS37H0IXDQ: I understood the experiment, and the quality of the video really influences the overall experience a lot, but what bothered me most were the pauses and crashes it really is irritating regardless of the quality of the video.
A2EARNRMFJOSIY: side by side comparison helps me more
A8DMLATJZOF4Q: Side-by-side reference is a must have for impairments like blur, for stal I think it's not completely necessary. There were some impairments that were mid play, these were very annoying, either live or during replay. There were a couple of them that were during parts where the players were either celebrating the goal or just after the ball goes out of the pitch, these were not that annoying.
A397QMUM40C4SH: nothing was confusing to me, i watch a lot of video's online so i know what good quality and bad quality looks like.
A22TYEGRHFUFQJ: the guideline was very clear, the timestamp is very important for example when the player is shooting live is not like on replay, since it is more annoying at crucial moments of the video, side-by-side comparison was not helpful compared to watch the video on a separate view.
A24Z3GWWZ8JUTM: It was most annoying when it happened in moments of tension (ball in front of enemy goal). Experiment guideline was clear, but i was a bit worried that i missed the blur, because i did not grade any video as blurred. I cross referenced with the test video but could not find any blur.
A6KEHDNT925VQ: The impairments affected me when specific moments of the video that were crucial to watch were spoiled. I did not needed the reference to change my thoughts on the grading. The guidelines were completely clear to me.
AFIK3VBMMX6G6: All contained stalls between 2-3.5 seconds. Timing of the stall made a big impact, such as when scoring
APC7FSVEKRIGT: the impairments of "stall" in annoying only when the action is near the goalkeeper
A1EGQAMPW9N5FT: When the impairment happen in a crucial moment, like when someone is to shoot, is more annoying
A29RR6SV0L4D8C: the experiment guideline was clear
A34YKQXWOMUZRC: Everything is very clear.
A3EHE32S5AS1I1: I think the reference is no longer needed. For me, the stalling is completely annoying whenever it occurs, because when it occurs once, it will happen again (frequently), hence i´m expecting for it and therefore not enjoying.
A1GV1WGA3W6CLG: Impairments at moments of suspense or excitement are much more annoying than those at other times. Do not need side-by-side reference.
A2FEWB3KWM7KX7: The test is very clear, I was able to understand quickly. Having a better quality video helps to understand the mistakes of the second. The second is made worse by knowing what a good quality is like.
ACBG07QLGIDP0: I think the stalling bad experience is highly dependent on the timestamp it occurs. I didn't see any blurring on the videos I was supposed to grade but in general, it was pretty straightforward. On the last question, I think it's important to have the reference video available to check. Not always necessary, but sometimes it is, so leave it available. One more thing. Give more time to the conclusion of the task. I did this one before, with the blurr impairment, and lost the reward because it took me more than 20min to finish the task and answer this final question. The task is very interesting by the way.
A305USYDAJUGI7: It was very clear, and it was easy for me to give grades by wacthing side-by-side comparison.
A14YT4Q8ZT8GYJ: It's annoying when something important it's going on at the video. it's clear. no confuse. Don't think I should look at the reference again, It's enough. 
A392XBUSSNVGRU: Nothing
