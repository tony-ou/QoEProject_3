#REASONING#
###########

A1UM7U8DA3RMA9: The new inclusion of pop up after loading full video helped, Because last time I didint able to find the stall is because of  slow network or its video stall issue, Also stall will make this type of sports video irritating
A2341KCW7BI2NS: the guidlines for this task are very clear,yes side by side comparison help me grading the video,its make easier for me,in some videos there are pauses that make me annoying.thanks
A4E1UYPDHE8D8: It's much more annoying when the video got stuck at crucial moment like when a player is taking an important corner kick that could lead to a goal. The duration of the time stuck is also important. The longer it is the more annoying it got. I have no other comments on the instructions or the experiment itself. The side-by-side comparison was useful but I only used it one time to refresh my memory.
A2F0X4LN9N4O4C: The impairments affect me watching every single detail of the video.  It is more annoying for the video to stall than to be blurry.  The experiment guideline is clear.  I am not confused by the grading.  I don't need the side by side video.
A1L8RL58MYU4NC: Nothing annoyed me. Guideline is superb. I didn't get confused in grading. Side-by-side made it easy but without that too one can grade it
A2BO8M77CS3SGZ: Some impairments are very annoying as they appear at important timestamps.
ASPRULQHB8B1F: When the video stutters it is really annoying, because we feel frustrated without knowing what's going on or what is gonna happen next. I don't think the side-by-side comparison is really necessary, since it is clear that it is a fully working high definiton video
A33VGSEJ44ORMF: I think the pausing makes it difficult to watch more so than the blur.  I think my brain and sort of sort out the blurs but when the video pauses its annoying in that is not in real time.  The guidlines were clear and I was not confused about grading.  The side by side was very helpful as it gave reference to what to grade the other on as far as quality goes.
A1NMKXK04PZ6KK: I think that whenever it stops it is equally impaired for me.  Most times I will just stop watching a video if it freezes or gets blurry no matter the time.
A3KNO82DZ519HG: WHEN IT INTERFERES WITH THE ACTION DURING THE GAME AT A POINT WHERE SOMETHING EXCITING OR IMPORTANT IS HAPPENING. GUIDELINE WAS CLEAR. SIDE BY SIDE FOR THE FIRST COUPLE WAS HELPFUL AFTER THAT MUCH LESS SO.
A1A1A9UHNQCI9Y: Impairments around the time when there is either a goal or a block are more annoying than passes because it takes you out of the action of the game. I thought that the instructions were clear. I didn't need to look at the reference again.
A3PGUPNMOU5BPW: Stutters that last long when an action is about to happen are more annoying. I think the side by side would change the way I percieve the annoyances. I think I could have mis graded some video.
A2F2DDH12YU4AK: Any stuttering of any sort is totally unacceptable, regardless of when the interruption occurs, and must necessarily result in the lowest possible score. Blurring isn't obviously a problem unless the video output is so blocky as to be unrecognizable. The side by side comparison was not at all helpful; splitting focus would have resulted in missing details in the target video.
AHV4U78TUUDKI: there were pixelations and several places where the video froze and I felt that when they occurred during the action, especially after the goal was scored made the video less exciting and it was a little more annoying to be honest. all the interruptions were annoying but some more than others. 
AEF74ZYJTTEIA: Where it occurs in the action and what you are missing
A29VL3MZE7YPBZ: If the video stops right before an exciting moment in the game, it is way more frustrating than if they were just running down the field.  Everything was clear.  I was not confused on the grading.  I think the side by side comparisons definitely helped me grade.
A1N62PWMUOG2YY: If the impairment is near the beginning it feels frustrating, but towards the end or in the middle of an "important action" it is even more frustrating because it makes me feel like I am missing out on something important. The guideline was clear to me. I looked at the reference video for the first test, but after that I did not find it necessary.
A3QZMGTVA4VO44: Some timestamps make my attention getting diverted. The guidelines are clear and nothing is confusing. Side-by-side comparison is highly helpful in grading. 
A1NH9LK567B862: I get really annoyed when the video got stuck for a moment. Guidelines are clear though. There is no need for the side by side comparison for grading. 
A1IHI23KH87K5W: If the pause happens at crucial moment, e.g. just after corner has been taken, or when someone is about to shoot, it's more annoying than when someone is celebrating a goal. In other words, context is everything.
A2YHSU2IJZ9J14: There were some bits of motion blur just before the corner kick which is not very noticeable, not sure if that is consider slight impairment or just a result of the video not being in HD ie lower bitrate.
A1OSRAPSRT934Z: Impairments at some timestamps are more annoying than others because sometimes more time is needed to load the video which causes buffering. The experiment guideline was clear and I was not confused about the grading. The side-by-side comparison helped with the grading because it was easy to compare the videos rather than watching them on different pages.
A2QD9PJUKW7PKK: sometimes the game is interesting and when there is stall its really frustrating. So basis on my frustration level i had given ranking
A2MCG5W6LHSRG9: i guess the longer i felt the pause was the more annoying it was or if it was at an exciting part in the video vs a dull moment. I really didn't need a side by side comparison to help
A3O7X46E3REM7I: It makes the viewing experience annoying. Everything was clear.
A2CFE6AZS73RNS: A pause in the action is more annoying than a pause when nothing exciting is going on - for example a pause when they are shooting is worse then a pause right after they have scored.  I thought the instructions were clear, but did not feel the need to rewatch the original reference again.
A3NBJ2WSWYJPWY: NOTHING
A2EDER9628S0A : I get concerned when videos stall because I think there might be something wrong and it might not start again. I didn't find the guidelines clear because I was not sure if you were implying that a blurred and stalled video was the worst or if I was allowed to say a very blurry one alone was still worst. I didn't feel I needed to have the side by side because it was clear each video had issues. 
ARTQWWNFA7IOD: pause of length at least 1 second test videos
A11SX02CICZN85: The experiment guideline is very clear and easy to understand. nothing is annoying in this hit. I haven't confuse in grading side-by-side comparison helps me to grade it easily. If it start play simultaneous means it will be much more easy   
A4T7PYGN1BE2P: i dont need to look at the reference again. it reduces my viewing experience.
ASWZO1WY1UHEP: Some timesstamps are more annoying than once at other timestamps. The guideline was clear. I think side by side comparison was help for me.
AVPD36WUJKJFS: Almost all the test videos had stall problem, Experiment guideline is clear, A little confuse on grading as all the test videos looks similar, And side by side comparison helped a lot
A3UV55HC87DO9C: I think that stalling during key moments is more annoying than when players are just standing around. The guidelines were clear and I thought the side by side comparison was helpful. Would probably be more helpful for trying to catch blur.
