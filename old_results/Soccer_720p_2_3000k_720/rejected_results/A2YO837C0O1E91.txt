Impairments within the first 5 seconds are more likely to ruin my enjoyment for the whole video. The guideline for grading is a little confusing because aside from rating a video "bad" due to impairments, it's tricky to know what separates a "good" video from a "perfect" one. I found that the side-by-side comparison helped a little bit, but I think i'd also do alright without it.
