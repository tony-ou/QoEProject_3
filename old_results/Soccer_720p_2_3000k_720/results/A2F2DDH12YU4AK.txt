Any stuttering of any sort is totally unacceptable, regardless of when the interruption occurs, and must necessarily result in the lowest possible score. Blurring isn't obviously a problem unless the video output is so blocky as to be unrecognizable. The side by side comparison was not at all helpful; splitting focus would have resulted in missing details in the target video.
