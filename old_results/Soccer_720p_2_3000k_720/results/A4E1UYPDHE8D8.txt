It's much more annoying when the video got stuck at crucial moment like when a player is taking an important corner kick that could lead to a goal. The duration of the time stuck is also important. The longer it is the more annoying it got. I have no other comments on the instructions or the experiment itself. The side-by-side comparison was useful but I only used it one time to refresh my memory.
