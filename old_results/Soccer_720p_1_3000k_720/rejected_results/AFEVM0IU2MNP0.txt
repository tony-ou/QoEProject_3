The experiment guidelines are clear.  The video impairments when the ball is in a scoring position are a lot more annoying then the impairments when nothing is happening.  The video where it stalled in the middle of the corner kick was way more annoying then the video that stalled after the goal, even though they stalled for the exact same length of time and everything else was perfect.  I didn't care after the goal because I already saw the action.  As for the side by side comparison, I looked at it one more time but really it was not necessary.
