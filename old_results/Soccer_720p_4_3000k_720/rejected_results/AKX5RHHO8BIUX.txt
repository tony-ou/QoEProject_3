A freeze early in a video is most annoying to me - I'm waiting for something to happen and assume I have some sort of problem. Next most annoying is right at the end, which gives me a false assumption that the video is over.  I really didn't need to look at the reference again, and didn't use it.  Otherwise it's all clear.
