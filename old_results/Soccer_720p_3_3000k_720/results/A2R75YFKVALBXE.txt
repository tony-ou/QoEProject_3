Stalls are usually the worst for me, completely lifting me out of the simulation of reality; a little bit of blur I can live with if they don't completely obscure the image. Guidelines are clear, nothing confusing, and the side-by-sides are helpful, especially in distinguishing the more subtle changes in blur.
