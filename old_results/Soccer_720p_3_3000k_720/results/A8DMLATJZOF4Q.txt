Side-by-side reference is a must have for impairments like blur, for stal I think it's not completely necessary. There were some impairments that were mid play, these were very annoying, either live or during replay. There were a couple of them that were during parts where the players were either celebrating the goal or just after the ball goes out of the pitch, these were not that annoying.
